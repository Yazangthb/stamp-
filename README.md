# Stamp recognition

## Project Description
Our project offers a solution for stamp detection, classification, and comparison using Maching learning and Computer Vision techniques. The primary goal is to facilitate the identification and analysis of stamps present in document scans.

## How to use
- POST    /images/upload - allows the user to upload images that they want to detect and classify the stamps on.
    - Input - scans of document in an image format (png, jpg) and the names for the corresponding stamps.
    - Output - [{stamp_name, stamp_picture, accuracy}, â€¦]
- POST    /images/add_stamp - allows the user to add new stamps to the database.
    - Input - {[stamp_name1, stamp_name2, ...], document_picture}
- Requests that will be added soon
    - POST    /images/compare - allows the user to compare two images of the stamps in order to check validity.
        - Input - 2 scans of documents in an image format.
        - Output - similarity score.
    - GET     /help - returns instructructions on how to use the API.

## Features

Our project offers the following key features, divided into four parts:

### 1. Data Augmentation

- **Creation of a dataset**: We generate a comprehensive dataset of documents with stamps by combining real documents with stamps generated with Stable Diffusion.

### 2. Stamp Detection

- **Detection**: Our system identifies stamp(s) present in document images using advanced image processing techniques.
- **Location determination**: We precisely locate the detected stamp(s) on the document, providing their coordinates.

### 3. Stamp Embedding

- **Feature extraction**: We utilize out own CNN model to generate embeddings from stamp images.
- **Vectorization of stamps**: The embeddings represent stamps as high-dimensional vectors, capturing their unique characteristics.

### 4. Classification

- **Distance calculation**: From the embeddings, we calculate the cosine similarity to measure the similarity between stamps.
- **Classification**: Based on the calculated distances, our system provides reliable classification results for stamps.
